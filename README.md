# personal-api

üë®‚Äçüé§ An API about me, myself and I. I am the API.

## Introduction

I've always been intrigued about a `Personal API`. The fascination of allowing the internet to retrieve data points about the mundane things in ones life is quite intriguing.

This is the beginning of a journey in adding a bunch of data data sources, that are then aggregated nd rolled up into the API you camn view.

Oh, and I'm still a relatively new **gopher**, so learning [https://golang.org](https://golang.org) is the other reason for this, thing.

## Data Sources

At the moment it's very much static data, but over time I hope to add certain data sources from the usual suspect of social networks, on top of physiological data from Withings, Strava and some other sources.
